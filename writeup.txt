Requirements:
- A running JVM 1.7 or newer. It may run on 1.6, but that is untested.
- Leiningen 2. Please see the http://leiningen.org site for instructions on how to install it. 
- Linux or Mac OS X. Tested with the later.

Usage:

lein run [filename or url]

Example:

lein run http://svcs.cs.pdx.edu/circuit-wiring/inst-3.txt

Output:

The program will use internally SAT4J, a SAT solver for Java. If a solution is found, it will be printed on the console. If no solution is found, it will be indicated in the console.
